CentErr has been inspired by the Central Error Handler concept that wraps the entire system to handle any uncaught application exception in a standardized and uniform way.

Once caught, exceptions or errors should be displayed to the user in a way that is appropriate for the mode in which application is used. For this purpose, CentErr offers different **Emitter** strategies for delivering error information in a format suitable for a *port* (web, CLI, API) application has been invoked through.

Before being shown to the user, errors typically require some pre-processing with a specific purpose. Therefore, CentErr features **Processors** that can be hooked into the error handling procedure, with concrete implementations for logging and suppressing errors.
